# Spa O2 Landing Page

My goal for this project is to recreate the landing page for Spa O2 in Branson, MO. I'm going to use the same text, but update eveything else while creating a more responsive design.

Spa O2 is owned by my parents and my mom has been using Wix for the website for a couple years. She created it by herself using their template and has been the only one that ever makes any updates to it. The site needs to be completely redesigned and more responsive.

Project Completion Update

I just finished up the landing page and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. This was my first solo project and happy with what I was able to accomplish.
